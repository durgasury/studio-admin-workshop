# Lab 5: Launch a Studio notebook

Now that you've logged in to the Studio UI, you can build, train, deploy and monitor models at scale.

## Task

1. Open the Launcher from Studio Home page. Change the environment and choose the LCC script you added to the user profile in Lab 3. Wait until the notebook is launched, and verify if the package is installed. 
2. Note the running instances and kernels icon on the left. This shows the number of running instances that the user is charged for. 
3. You can clone the [sagemaker-examples](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) repository and run through notebook.
